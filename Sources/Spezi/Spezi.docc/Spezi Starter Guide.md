## Introduction
This guide is designed to assist newcomers and potential contributors in navigating the Spezi open-source project. It serves as an initial point of reference, providing an overview and links to helpful documents, as well as tips on how and where to start.

## A Three-Step Spezi Starter Guide
Below are three fundamental steps we recommend to familiarize yourself with the Spezi ecosystem. These are designed to provide a structured way of understanding Spezi.

### First Step: Introducing Spezi
In this section, we introduce the initial steps to get acquainted with Spezi. Understanding Spezi as a project and the topics it covers is crucial. Here are some resources to help you get started:

1. The **[Spezi Website](#https://spezi.stanford.edu/)** offers an excellent introduction to the project and explains the goals of the open-source initiative.

2. The **[Spezi Notion Page](https://www.notion.so/Research-Opportunities-8ff2893741164e3b9b99ee4da8d992a3?pvs=4)** is a great resource to view current project topics and read guidelines for research collaboration.

3. The **[Spezi Ecosystem Page](#spezi-ecosystem)** provides a comprehensive overview of the modules and their use cases.

### Second Step: Trying out the Spezi Template Application
Once you have a basic understanding of Spezi, it's beneficial to test the framework on your own machine using the template application. This is how: 

1. Access the **[Template Application(#https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/SpeziTemplateApplication)]** here.

2. Continue with the **Setup Instructions**:
   - Start by **forking the repository**.
   @Row{
      @Column {
         ![Screenshot displaying where how to fork.](Resources/Fork.png)
      }
   }
   
   - Use the terminal on your Mac to **clone the forked repository locally**. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the template application.
   - Follow the setup and run instructions provided here: [Setup Guide](https://spezi.health/SpeziTemplateApplication/documentation/templateapplication/setup)

> **Note**: You may need to update packages.
